# Project
This is the work I have done for my project for the module CTEC3905 Front-End Web Development. 
The reason I chose to develop a website which advertises a car company is because my father back in Cyprus
has his own car company and I built this website so in the future I can add a back-end to it, develop it more
and maybe make it a real website of my father's store. 

The first page I built is the home page. I would go over the lab material I had on blackboard, get some ideas about things
I was told in the lectures or the labs and try to implement them to my website. I created some simple javascripts, and 
added a few animations in my css which I got from the labs as examples. After I pretty much finished the layour of the home page,
the other pages were a lot easier to create as they were based on the same structure as the home page. In the stock page, I was
struggling to manage to make the photos align perfectly and be responsive and it was the hardest part of the development. 
I did not use any external frameworks, but some JavaScripts or CSS pieces were written with the help of w3schools.com. I
also used that website to validate my website for errors because it has an html validator which showed a few warnings and errors
which I was able to fix. Stackoverflow.com was also helpful when I could not manage to do something I wanted. 

The material that were the most helpful to me from the whole module was how to make a website responsive.
I had created some simple websites in the past from the first year at university but I had never tried to make them mobile first.
Paying attention to things like breakpoints and how they work to make a website mobile friendly was significant. It was entirely new
for me and I took me some time to understand how it works but after I got the point I managed to make the whole website responsive.

The only thing that I have been trying to do for a long time was to populate the modals of the stock from data in a Json file, but after
multiple tries I could not manage to do it so I had to find another way, which was using JavaScript.

It was pleasant to attend the module and it also helped me very much to develop the website of my Final Year Project as well.
